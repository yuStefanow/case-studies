# GraphQL Design Specifics

---
## Schema Design:
---

* **Types & Fields:** Design your schema with types representing data models (e.g., User, Product) and fields representing attributes (e.g., name, price).

* **Resolvers:** Define resolvers that map schema fields to your backend logic.

* **N+1 Problem:** Avoid inefficient database queries by batching and caching requests.

---
## Query Design:
---

* **Efficient Queries:** Clients can request exactly what they need, reducing the amount of data transmitted.

* **Avoid Over-fetching/Under-fetching:** Make sure queries are flexible and responsive to various data needs.

---
## Error Handling:
---

* **Structured Errors:** GraphQL typically returns errors in a errors field in the response, which provides helpful debugging information.
