# Performance Optimization

---
## Caching:
---

* **Server-Side Caching:** Use HTTP headers like Cache-Control and ETag for caching at the server level.

* **CDN:** Use Content Delivery Networks (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) for global caching to reduce latency.

---
## Pagination & Filtering:
---

* **Offset Pagination:** For simple datasets, use ?page=1&limit=20.

* **Cursor-Based Pagination:** Use a cursor to handle large, dynamic datasets.

* **Query Parameters for Filtering:** Allow users to filter results based on different fields (e.g., ?status=active&category=electronics).

---
## Compression:
---

* **gzip:** Use gzip compression for API responses to reduce bandwidth and improve performance.

---
## Load Balancing:
---

* **Horizontal Scaling:** Distribute API traffic across multiple servers to prevent bottlenecks.

* **API Gateways:** Use API gateways (e.g., Kong, NGINX, AWS API Gateway) to manage, secure, and route traffic.
